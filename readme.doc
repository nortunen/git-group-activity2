You can see that we did a fast forward merge because there were no branches that diverge from the 
develop branch. Additionally, all branches were merged with the develop branch at the time of the merge.

Merge Conflict Scenario: In a collaborative project there are two executive members who want to 
update a page on the website - the "develop" branch is controlled by one of the original members 
going to update the page, while the "conflict_branch" is a new executive wanting to change the wording 
of the website. Both executive members will try and change the text on the page within a shared file, 
leading to conflicting changes. When attempting to merge the branches, Git encounters a merge conflict, 
requiring manual intervention to adjust the differing alterations and ensure the codebase remains 
functional and coherent.

No Merge Conflict Scenario: In a collaborative project, two executive members are working on their 
company website. Upon completing their respective tasks, they aim to synchronize the 'develop' branch
with the 'main' branch to view each other's contributions. Since the alterations do not overlap 
or affect the same lines of code, merging the branches proceeds without encountering conflicts, 
ensuring seamless integration of the changes.
